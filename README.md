# This is my blog source code 

This is my personal blog using minimalist Jekyll theme which is called [Lagrange](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange) 

My old blog is made with Hexo and Nodejs which is not easy to change the article and manage. You can view my new blog at [Sunny Blog](https://shusunny.github.io/sunnyblog/)

* Compatible with GitHub Pages.
* Support for Jekyll's built-in Sass/SCSS preprocessor and data files for making customizing easier.
* [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) support.
* Commenting support powered by [Disqus](https://disqus.com/).
* Optimized for search engines.
* LaTeX support through [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).

I can't find my Hexo setting and I also don't want to use Nodejs anymore.

I am learning golang these days. And I will keep posting my updates use this github site. You can find my old blog at https://shusunny.github.io

之前的Hexo博客设置弄丢了，懒得再重弄一遍了。（毕竟nodejs的创始人都转用Go去了）

以后就在这里随便记录下我的更新好了。我会慢慢把内容移过来的

There is nothing new these days.

I am learning Drunk Coding these days. That is an awesome golang course while the teacher always teach with wine.

It's called [Learn How To Code: Google's Go (golang) Programming Language](https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/)

Hope you guys can enjoy it.
